# Compression Algorithms
<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
<p>Provide a Java or C++ implementation of the LZ77 compression algorithm.</p>

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
<p>Provide a Java implementation of the LZW compression algorithm.</p>
<p>The task involves taking the path to the file for compression and creating a compressed file (the compressed file can be represented as numbers). 
The same applies to decompression.</p>
<p>Creating a GUI for this assignment is optional.</p>

<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
<p>Provide a Java implementation of the Standard Huffman compression algorithm.</p>
<p>GUI and Binary file implementation is mandatory.</p>

<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
<p>Implement Vector quantization compression and decompression in Java on a gray scale image (RGB image is a bonus).</p>
<p>GUI and Binary file implementation is mandatory.</p>

<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
<p></p>Implement 2D Predictive Coding compression and decompression in Java on a gray scale image.</p>
<p>GUI and Binary file implementation is mandatory.</p>
